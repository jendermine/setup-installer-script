Windows Batch:(for speed): To copy/move files 
Windows Powershell:(for heavy lifting tasks): To open/mount/eject CD-drives/isos

Also, contains a Adminstrator Check which uses fsutil to query drive for a 'dirty' bit, which requires a admin access ie.., you can check for adminstrator access without modifying/accessing/opening/executing any file/program. Since, windows is sh!t in providing any command for this.
